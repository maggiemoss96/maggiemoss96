# Teaching Philosophy {style="color: #38607a"}

-   ​Engage students through immersive, field-centered instruction to convey geologic concepts using real-world examples drawn from active volcanic systems

-   Foster an inclusive learning environment that encourages curiosity, collaboration, and critical observation.

-   Design and implement interactive learning experiences, including small-group problem solving, student-led discussions, and hands-on field activities, that emphasize hypothesis development, data interpretation, and peer-to-peer teaching.

-   Equip students with practical Earth science problem-solving skills by integrating field observations, laboratory analyses, and group-based projects.

-   Strengthen students’ ability to work effectively in teams and to recognize the relevance of geologic processes in both natural landscapes and societal contexts.

-   Mentor and inspire students to pursue continued engagement with geology by modeling professional scientific practice, stewardship of public lands, and pathways toward advanced study and geoscience careers.
