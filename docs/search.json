    "text": "Maggie Moss is a Geosciences PhD student at Colorado State University studying the geochemistry and petrology of the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field’s basaltic magma system. Moss holds a Master of Urban Planning degree from New York University, where she focused on natural hazards and city planning. Her background in petrography, field geology, and physical volcanology began as an undergraduate at George Washington University, where she received a Luther Rice Fellowship to study silicic volcanism associated with Yellowstone’s third caldera cycle.\nMoss recently received the Jack Kleinman Memorial Foundation grant to support her fieldwork, as well as funding from the Colorado Scientific Society to launch an undergraduate mentorship program that has engaged six high-achieving students in summer fieldwork and four in ongoing laboratory research. She also leads an interdisciplinary team synthesizing geochemical and geophysical data to develop a conceptual model of the magmatic plumbing system at Akutan, one of the USGS’s very high-threat volcanoes.\nIn the first year of her Ph.D., Moss successfully planned and executed a month of fieldwork in Yellowstone National Park, mapping and sampling the Junction Butte basalt, Undine Falls basalt, and the basalt of the Narrows. In her first semester, she obtained an NPS research permit, trained six undergraduate and four graduate students as field assistants, and collaborated with the Yellowstone Park Archeologist to document Indigenous obsidian artifacts in her study areas."

AGU Fall Meeting, New Orleans, LA, December 2025. (First Author, Presenting) \nAbstract:\nThe integration of geophysical and petrological datasets remains a grand challenge in understanding the magmatic structures feeding volcanic systems. The multidisciplinary observations required to characterize a volcanic system span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Devising a holistic model for magmatic structures and processes requires placing these disparate pieces into a unified framework. Here we synthesize and reanalyze existing petrological and geophysical constraints for the magmatic system at Akutan, an active stratocone in the eastern Aleutian arc. Akutan has exhibited surface deformation continually since its first geodetic observations in the 1990s and produced significant seismic swarms between 1996 and 2010, with 26 known eruptions between 1900 and 1992. The results of reanalyzing seismic, geodetic, petrologic, and other data produce a coherent conceptual model of Akutan’s magma storage and transport processes, which is defined by: (1) A partial-melt body at 8-10 kmbsl, indicated by 1D velocity models, seismic tomography, seismicity, whole rock geochemical trends, melt-inclusion volatile contents, and magnetotelluric studies. This is also consistent with median pressures using pyroxene-only barometry. Conduit branches from the body to 0-5 km depth are also indicated.  (2) Island-wide pulses of centimeter-level geodetic deformation, deep, long-period earthquakes occurring beneath the storage depth, and hot erupted magmas that indicate frequent inputs from the deeper crust. Akutan stands as an example of a well-studied system where independent constraints converge on a consistent model for the underlying magmatic structure. Such convergence may not necessarily be observed at other Aleutian volcanoes. This work for Akutan builds on the NSF-PREEVENTS synthesis efforts at 5 other Aleutian volcanoes, offering a framework for integrating multidisciplinary observations to infer conceptual models for magmatic systems at active volcanoes. \n\nFigure 1.

Red stars show location of long-period seismic events that may indicate movement of fluids from deeper magmatic sources.\nFigure 2.
